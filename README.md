This code implements trajectory optimization via vanilla sequential convex programming. An example for swinging-up a cart pole is given, and the algorithm is applied to quadrotor fleet trajectory optimization. Collision avoidance constraint is linearized according to this [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/6385823)

## Installation
This code requires CVXPY and JAX
